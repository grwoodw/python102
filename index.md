Python is quickly becoming one of the most popular programming 
languages for research.  Not only is it easier to learn than lower level 
languages like Fortran and C/C++ but there are also a plethora of open
source libraries available to aid in research.

This workshop will build on simpler python workshops and tutorials by
providing experience with several libraries that are commonly used in
research.
